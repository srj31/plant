# Plant

This repository consists of the source code for Plant, an innovative game that is advocating the knowledge for climate change.

## Steps to Replicate Development Environment

- Ensure Flutter is installed on your system. On macOS, you can install it via Homebrew. In order to check if everything works from the installation, run the following command. Resolve issues pointed by it, if any.

```
flutter doctor
```

- VSCode is the recommended development environment since the Flutter and Dart extension pack has many features.

- If you are developing for iOS, ensure you have the Simulator app that comes with XCode.

- Run the Simulator for the device of your choice.

- If you have the Flutter extensions on VSCode, you can directly run the application by clicking on the run button Run without debugging on the top right corner.

- Alternatively, CLI can be used to run the application. Find your device by running the following command.

```
flutter devices
```

- To run the application, run the following command in the root.

```
flutter run [-d | --device-id] <device-of-choice>
```
